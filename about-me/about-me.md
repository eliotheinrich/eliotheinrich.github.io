Hello! I am a physics PhD student at Boston college. Over my undergraduate and graduate years, I've worked on
a variety of interesting problems from radio observation of pulsars to topological and open quantum systems to Monte
Carlo simulations of classical spin systems. Most recently, my work has focused on simulation and characterization of
dynamic phase transitions in classically simulable subtheories of quantum mechanics. Click on my Projects tab to see a little
about some of these!

For much of my time as a graduate student, I have also worked as a high-performance computing research assistant at Boston College.
In that role, I provided computing consulting to researchers using our Andromeda compute cluster, managed public software modules,
and aggregated and reported usage data which informed cluster policy.

Outside of physics research and computing, I love dancing. I am a competitive west coast swing dancer and travel frequently on the
weekends for competitions and social dancing.
